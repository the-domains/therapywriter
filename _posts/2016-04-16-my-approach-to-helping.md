MY APPROACH TO HELPING

Life can sometimes overwhelm all of us and leave us wondering where to turn for answers. Our usual sources of support -- friends, family and loved ones -- might not know how to help. Or maybe they have become part of the problem. 

If you're reading this, you're considering seeking the help of a therapist in resolving your problems. My approach to therapy is to help you identify and use strengths you might never have recognized in yourself, or those you've begun to doubt. When we are troubled --- especially when we are anxious or depressed --- we have difficulty rallying these strengths. We become self-critical. We become biased against ourselves at a time when we most need to be for ourselves.

Therapy works to a great degree because it offers the warmth of company and a sense of belonging -- the feeling of being accepted as worthy and valuable by the therapist sitting across from you. Therapy works through comforting and restorative conversation. Blended into the conversation are study-proven techniques that lead to more effective thinking and behavior. The goal is to help you achieve a new appreciation of yourself and your prospects in the world.

Someone once said of poetry, "Few go to it, but many suffer from the lack of what can be found there." The same can be said of psychotherapy. It offers a rare chance to find and embrace who you truly are while resolving the specific, stressful problem that brought you to therapy in the first place.
