One of the things I like best about what I do is coming across a client who truly loves what she or he does, whether for a living or as a personal interest. No matter what it might be -- art, craft, profession --- I love to hear the person across from me speak in detail about what they do and how they do it. The intense interest and enjoyment they take from what they do enlivens them. I can see it in their eyes, hear it in their voice. Often, they gesture with their hands, words alone not exclamation enough to stress their point.

One of the most fulfilled people I know --- not a client but a friend in his 80s --- has lived most of his life as a river runner, a horse outfitter and fierce environmentalist. His passion is for the land of Southern Utah. As a young man in his 20s, he fell in love with the idea of letting the Colorado River carry him and his client-explorers through canyons cut deep into the vast sagebrush country around them. It is land so colorful that Native Americans called it the land of frozen rainbows. The Native Americans were referring to the sandstone arches that span the canyons, bridging the two sides. Perhaps they were also referring to the layers of red, brown, and deep mahogany stone that form the canyon walls. My friend's emphasis was on following the course of the land, gliding along the river or riding up on the sage, disturbing as little of the natural setting as possible. After all, it was the natural setting that he and his customers came to see. He views what he was doing as proper use of the land. He does not see as proper the philosophy of altering the land to suit human growth, as the U.S. government did when it built Glen Canyon Dam in the 60s.

The dam backed up the Colorado River and inundated the natural cathedral in the desert that was Glen Canyon, a subterranean oasis of lush green plants shaded from the direct rays of the searing desert sun by canyon walls trickling with water seeping from aquifers. The light that reached the canyon floor was soft, and reflected off the water to flicker and dance against the walls. Also lost to the rising water were the mysteriously abandoned Anasazi tribal ruins, the only lasting sign of a people who simply disappeared from the Earth without explanation. The water pooled and created Lake Powell, a popular setting for powerboaters who come in numbers so large that their feces has become a major source of pollution. My friend sees the blue, man-made lake, pretty as it might be, as a grave marker for something far more beautiful and natural, lying dead below.

As the water rose behind Glen Canyon Dam, my friend added environmentalism to his list of passions. It is a passion that will live in him until he draws his last breath. Still, he and other environmentalists lost their battle to save Glen Canyon, all their protests in court having been rejected in favor of a national policy to develop the Southwest for human consumption: Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Vegas. My friend persisted in his other passions --- running the river, living in a land of beauty, avoiding the rat race. But his life was not as easy as some might think. Romantic, yes, but easy, no. He worked hard and lived lean for most of his life, never realizing much profit until he was in his 60s. By that time, he was owner of a working ranch he turned into a guest ranch, set halfway up the volcano-shaped peaks of the LaSalle Mountains of Southeastern Utah. Tough times came and tough times went, and never did he think about turning back on what he knew was his life adventure. The challenges had payoffs; he lived an independent life richly stimulated by the spirituality of the land around him.

Unfortunately, too many people don't have work they love. They struggle with jobs they find to be pressure-packed and thankless. And the pay? Does a lot of money compensate for working a job that drains the enthusiasm from life? Well, I've spoken with people who make a lot of money but who still hate their work and, far too often, hate their lives as a result. Although my friend showed exceptional courage and independence of purpose in living the life he loved, not everyone has the courage, not everyone can create the circumstances, to follow his example. But, even though they may be shackled to a thankless job, they can develop an avocation --- even if it earns no money --- that can energize their lives. I've known people to find it in fishing; I've known people to find it in running or bicycling; I've known people to find it in writing; I've known people to find it in reading; I've known people to find it in raising and racing homing pigeons; I've known people to find it in dog-breeding; I've known people to find it in endless self-learning. All of these are examples of interests we can embrace and master, or at least work toward mastering, that can focus us on the worthwhile of life, something that is ours, that we can enjoy and control without interference. Whether they are the successful and high functioning clients in my private practice or the chronically mentally ill clients I once saw in a community clinic, I recommend they aggressively pursue their chosen vital interests or develop one if they haven't already. True to the word "vital," they are life-giving.
