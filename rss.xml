            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Vital Interests</h1><p>One of the things I like best about what I do is coming across a client who truly loves what she or he does, whether for a living or as a personal interest. No matter what it might be – art, craft, profession — I love to hear the person across from me speak in detail about what they do and how they do it. The intense interest and enjoyment they take from what they do enlivens them. I can see it in their eyes, hear it in their voice. Often, they gesture with their hands, words alone not exclamation enough to stress their point.</p></article>]]></description>
